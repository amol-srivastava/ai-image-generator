# AI-Image Generator

AI-Image Generator is a web application I've created to allow users to generate AI-driven images based on text prompts. By leveraging OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model, users can input a detailed description of the image they want and receive visually compelling AI-created images. The application features a user-friendly interface with an input field for text prompts and a "Generate" button to fetch the images. Additionally, a "Surprise Me" feature offers random creative prompts for users to explore. This project demonstrates how I integrated advanced AI capabilities with a straightforward yet effective front-end developed using React and a back-end server built with Express.

## Features

- Generate AI-driven images from text prompts.
